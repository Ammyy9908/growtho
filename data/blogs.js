      "A logo is essential in any business, big or small, to provide a visual identity and as a recognizable symbol of your organization logo is critical for business success through brand-recognition. Having a strong logo and brand enables customers to automatically locate the brand at a glance. People will come to recognize your brand at a glance, and the more they see it, the more you will be remembered as the “go to” company for your particular product or service. A logo is something that you should be proud to include on building and car signage, on company clothing and stationery. Your logo needs to be a unique and recognizable representation of you, and your products and services. A logo leads the horse (your audience) to water (your company).Logos are a point of identification; they’re the symbol that customers use to recognize your brand. A good logo is a visual, aesthetically pleasing element, it triggers positive recall about your brand that the name of your company alone might not. Some of your audience will likely forget the name of your business but they`ll immediately associate your logo with their memories of your brand.",
